        <h3>Welcome...</h3>
        <p>Greetings and welcome to my digital haven! I'm Justin DeMatteis, 
            an enthusiast at the intersection of technology, coding, and the vast possibilities 
            that the digital realm offers. Here, within the virtual confines of this space, 
            I'm excited to share my journey, diverse projects, and the passions that fuel my creativity.
        </p>
        <p> As an individual with a passion for creativity and problem-solving, I am currently immersed in the 
            enriching curriculum of triOS College&#39;s Web Developer program. Delving into the realms of design, 
            front-end, and back-end web development, this program offers a comprehensive learning experience that 
            seamlessly integrates theory with practical applications. In this journey, I am honing industry-grade 
            logic and problem-solving skills, eagerly exploring the diverse landscape of development technologies.
        
                
        Completing the program involves hands-on projects, culminating in mobile and web capstone projects where I construct 
        real-world applications to showcase to potential employers.
        
        <p>As a current student in this program, I am benefiting from:
        <ul>
        <li>a 12-week internship for valuable hands-on experience</li>
        <li>earning a registered and approved diploma</li>
        <li>access to practice tests (where applicable)</li>
        <li>career services</li>
        <li>assistance in job searches</li>
        <li>alumni program benefits</li>
        <li>three certification exam</li>

        </ul></p>
        
        <p>The program exposes me to a comprehensive array of core technologies, tools, and methodologies, including 
        <ul>
        <li>Adobe Creative Cloud</li> 
        <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>WordPress</li> 
        <li>Linux systems (Fedora and Ubuntu)</li>
        <li>Git and GitHub</li>
        <li>Agile practices</li>
        <li>Java, Swift</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Angular</li>
        <li>React, 
        PHP, 
        MySQL,  
        XAMPP</li>
    </ul></p>
        
       <p>The courses within the program lead towards three industry certification examinations, namely Adobe Photoshop ACA, 
        Adobe Illustrator ACA, and Oracle Java Associate, providing a valuable benchmark for hiring.</p>
